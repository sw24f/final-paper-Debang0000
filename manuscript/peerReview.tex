\section{Review}
To my understanding, the goal of the research paper is to generate a predictive model to better identify individuals at higher risk for recidivism, and to enhance decision-making surrounding this process in the criminal justice system.
The author explores Logistic Regression, LASSO, and Random Forest (RF) to fulfill the addressed gap in advanced models for predicting inmates at higher risk for recidivism.
The author concludes that RF is the most fair and accurate model in this case, showing a high accuracy and relatively low false positive and false negative rates.
Lastly, the author rightfully addresses the need to evaluate fairness in these advanced models as to not reinforce biases regarding race, economic status, and other factors.
The major comments on this paper are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. Address fairness in the models
    \item In the initial questions proposed, one was to assess the accuracy and fairness of the models used. 
\item 3qedas
\item qwedsa
\end{itemize}
